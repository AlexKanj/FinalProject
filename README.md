### Data Set 1: (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data) This data set contains all arrests that occured in different areas and neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It was provided by the City of Pittsburgh.

### Data Set 2: (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks1) This data set contains information about parks throughout Pittsburgh. Information was also provided by the City of Pittsburgh

### Data Set 3: (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-walk-scores) This data set contains the information about the walkscores of different neighborhoods in Pittsbrugh. The data was provided by Allegheny County.

### For this project we were trying to find out which neighborhood would be the best to start a family in by comparing the arrest rates, amount of parks nearby and the walkscore of the neighborhood.
